# ML Projects
Adding all of the projects related to predictive modeling and analysis

## Notebook Description
### 1. can-i-be-an-influencer-through-ann
The objective is to develop a predictive model that can accurately predict an image's lifetime download count based on photographs' various features such as the camera type, location, lighting conditions, and other image-specific characteristics. The prediction is executed using Artificial Neural Network for this scenario.
### 2. can-i-be-an-influencer-through-regression
The objective is to develop a predictive model that can accurately predict an image's lifetime download count based on photographs' various features such as the camera type, location, lighting conditions, and other image-specific characteristics. The prediction is performed with Linear Regression.
### 3. image-recognition-through-cnn
The aim of this exercise is to execute character identification on a 94-character TMINST dataset through deep learning techniques. The character-determining technique we are using here is Convolutional Neural Network.
### 4. lung-cancer-prediction-regression
The purpose of this exercise is to identify which features (factors) affect the patient's health most and cause lung cancer, at the same time developing a predictive model that can detect lung cancer in patients at an early stage. The modeling is performed using Logistic Regression, I have also used Auto ML to identify the best-fit models.
